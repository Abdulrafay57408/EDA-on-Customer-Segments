# **Customer Spending Analysis - EDA Project**  

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Behavior & Spending Patterns**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics, spending behavior, and engagement patterns using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can help in **targeted marketing strategies** and **business decision-making**.  

## **📂 Dataset Description**  
The dataset includes customer details such as:  
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Level, Income Level  
- **Behavioral Data**: Interactions with customer service, Preferred Communication Channel, Segmentation Group  
- **Transactional Data**: Coverage Amount, Premium Amount, Purchase Frequency  

## **🛠 Tools & Libraries Used**  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📑  
- Seaborn 🎨  
- Matplotlib 📊  
- NumPy 🔢  

## **📊 Key Steps**  
✔ **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed outliers, and transformed categorical features.  
✔ **Data Visualization** – Used histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships.  
✔ **Feature Engineering** – Created new attributes like **Purchase Frequency** and **Income Range**.  

## **🔍 Insights Discovered**  
- **Age & Income Trends**: Majority of customers fall within **32-57 years**, with an average income of **\$82K**.  
- **Spending Patterns**: Mid-income customers (\$50K–\$80K) exhibit **higher purchase frequencies**.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: **Segments 3 & 5** have the most engagement, while Segment 2 underperforms.  
- **Product Preferences**: Policies **`policy1` & `policy5`** are the most popular.  



## **🚀 Next Steps**  
- Further analysis with **predictive modeling** (Regression & Classification).  
- Customer segmentation for personalized marketing strategies.
